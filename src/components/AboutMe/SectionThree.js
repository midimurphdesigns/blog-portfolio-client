            Growing up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., I always admired my father's software business and aspired to work with computers. I graduated from the University of Vermont with a BA in anthropology and used this degree to land an internship for web development with the Smithsonian Institution. This showed me the basics of what a web dev does and I was hooked.

          Over the next few years I studied hard, sharpening the tools necessary to make modern web apps. I have recently finished a full-stack engineering immersion program by Thinkful and am looking to apply everything I know in as many ways as I can. When I'm away from my computer I'm usually playing my guitar or hiking.
